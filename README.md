## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section covers:

- Price trend behavior  
- Volatility patterns  
- Volume dynamics  
- Short-term vs long-term moving averages  
- Momentum shifts and trend reversals  

These analyses reveal TSLA’s high-growth periods, corrections, and market sentiment over time.

## 2. Feature Engineering

Constructed predictive features include:

- 20-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages  
- Price momentum indicators  
- Volume-based features  
- Lag features  
- Target shifting for supervised learning  

These features help the model capture both short-term and medium-term market patterns.

## 3. Predictive Modeling

A Random Forest Regressor was trained and evaluated.

**Model Performance**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE (tuned model) | 21.46 |
| R² Score | 0.94 |

Hyperparameter tuning prioritized generalization and reduced overfitting, which is important when modeling financial time-series data.

## 4. Visualizations

- Price trend  
- Daily trading volume  
- Moving averages  
- Actual vs predicted closing prices  
- Additional supporting charts  

These visualizations strengthen the interpretability of the analysis.
